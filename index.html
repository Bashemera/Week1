            <h2>Git and Version Control</h2>
            <p>
                We all know <strong>“Necessity is the mother of all inventions”</strong>. And similarly Git was also
                invented to fulfill certain necessities that the developers faced before Git. So, let us take a step
                back to learn all about Version Control Systems (VCS) and how Git came into existence.

                Version Control is the management of changes to documents, computer programs, large websites and other
                collection of information.
            </p>
            <h4>Examples of Version Control System include:</h4>

            <p>
                GitHub is a Git repository hosting service, but it adds many of its own features. While Git is a <font
                    color="blue">command line tool</font>, GitHub provides a Web-based graphical interface. It also
                provides access control and several collaboration features, such as a wikis and basic task management
                tools for every project

                Pivotal Tracker is a <i>straightforward project-planning tool </i>that helps software development teams
                form realistic expectations about when work might be completed based on the team's ongoing performance.
                ... Pivotal Tracker encourages a practical agile software development process, as pioneered by Pivotal

            <h2>CSS</h2>
            <p>
                CSS stands for <b>Cascading Style Sheets</b>. CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on
                screen, paper, or in other media. CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web
                pages all at once. External stylesheets are stored in CSS files.

            <h2>Visual Studio Code</h2>
            <p>
                Visual Studio Code combines the simplicity of a <u>source code editor</u> with powerful developer
                tooling, like IntelliSense code completion and debugging.

                First and foremost, it is an editor that gets out of your way. The delightfully frictionless
                edit-build-debug cycle means less time fiddling with your environment, and more time executing on your
                ideas.
